For the authorization part it is important to be able to specify who has access to what data. The most flexible way of creating such a system is using attributed-based access control (ABAC).

Every Firebase Function is transferer to a Google Cloud function and will run on its own machine. They are triggered by events from Firestore and Firebase Auth and make the system flexible to extend. One use case we have is to use Python Google Functions to retrieve the best activities for users using machine learning. Python functions can also trigger on the Firebase events making the whole system pretty extensible to anything we need. Alternatives to Google functions are AWS Lambda on the Amazon cloud. A buzzword that is often used to describe these functions is serverless architecture. This serverless paradigm plays well with SvelteKit that embraces this serverless paradigm that can be contrasted to running your own node.js servers. ",
